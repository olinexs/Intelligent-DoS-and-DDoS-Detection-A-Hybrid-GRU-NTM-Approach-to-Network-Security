## Overview

This repository contains the code for the research paper titled "Intelligent DoS and DDoS Detection: A Hybrid GRU-NTM Approach to Network Security," which presents a hybrid deep learning model combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Neural Turing Machine (NTM) layers for enhanced intrusion detection in cybersecurity. This model was tested on UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT datasets, achieving a 99% accuracy rate in distinguishing between normal, DoS, and DDoS traffic, which marks a significant advancement in real-time threat detection.
